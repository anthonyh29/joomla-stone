## Getting Started

The template file can be uploaded to Joomla 'as-is' and should work with Zurb Foundation 5 straight out of the box.  For more information and details on how to get going with Foundation you can visit the ['Getting Started'](http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/) section of the Zurb Foundation website.

It is advisable to open the folder in a text-editor of your choice such as Sublime Text / Adobe Edge Code to edit the templateDetails.xml file before you upload the template file to your Joomla Installation.
